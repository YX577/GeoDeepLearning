## Deep learning, remote sensing

Getting training data from Planet imagery products to make a Superpixel-based convolutional neural network for sentinel 1&2 images classification.


### Study Site and Time


### Image Acquisition
1) Sentinel-1

2) Sentinel-2

3) Satellite Imagery and Archive | Planet. 
In this research Planet products (SkySat or RapidEye) will be usesd as a Reference map for assessing deep network output.

### Sentinel-2 derived Indices and S1 SAR imagery
