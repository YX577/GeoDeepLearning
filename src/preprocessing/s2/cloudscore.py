"""
This module generate a cloudScore band in Sentinel-2
images. It is a adaptation of the javascript code:
http://bit.ly/Sen2CloudFree.

Functions
----------
  - rescale: scale images considering a range
  - dilatedErossion: applied morphological opening
                   and closing to images.
  - computeS2CloudScore: Compute cloudScore in a Sentinel-2 ee.Image

    exp ('str'): The expression to apply
    thresholds (list): The value mapped to 0 and 1.

  The opening operation is applied first in order to

    erosion (float): The erosion kernel radius.
    dilation (float): The dilation kernel radius.
